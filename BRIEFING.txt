Baseado no site arquivador de uso violento (ou não) de armas de fogo, o americano Gun Violence Archive (GVA), resolvemos desenvolver uma inciativa visando a neutralidade 

Based on the american Gun Violence Archive, the website which tries to archive every usage of fire weapons on american soil, registering when, where and how many victims were involved, we decided to develop a independent brazilian iniative to register and map gun usage occurrencies. It's a pertinent and actual theme because new brazilian president is strongly in favor of gun owning and faces a though resistance by the opposition. The actual research institutes carries a lot of biases for both sides. Our pourpose and motivation is to provide unbiased data, showing when, where, how and why guns were used so people may use our database to make their own analysis.
Our methodology will be based on automated or semi automated search inquiries, going the other way around the original GVA institute does. GVA institute is a nonprofit organization doing manual curation of gun violence news. We hope our algorithm may be used for other purposes like searching for other news categories and our main goal is to learn and acquire experience doing some social pertinent discussion.
